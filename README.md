## ðŸ¤” Problem
Open source contributions are one of the best and fastest way to master any programming language/framework. But, often only a few repositories/organisation get all the attention and this leads to too much crowding in the popular repositories. Some people still manage to stay consistent and gradually become a regular contributor. But the newbies often get confused(and even scared) and don't ever get the opportunity to contribute.

## âœ¨ Features
- Web app which uses [Github APIs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and possibly [CHAOSS Augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur) to determine community health for different organsations
- Emailing users to stay consistent and notifying whenever new easily fixable issues arise. Github provides issue notifications through email but they aren't specific to a tag(or a comnbination of them). Mostly you'll just find your email being full of github issue emails !
- Tech Stack : React, Django
